AccDC API - 2.0.3 for jQuery (08/28/2013)
=====

AccDC is a scalable, cross-browser and cross-platform compatible Dynamic Content Management System that automates the rendering of dynamic content to ensure accessibility for screen reader and keyboard only users.

Supported by the Royal Society of Arts, AccDC was awarded the "Above and Beyond Accessibility Award" from the United States Department of Labor, and was presented at the Developing with Accessibility Event, hosted by the Federal Communications Commission in Washington DC in 2012.

This version of AccDC is an API that interfaces with jQuery as an extension.
All of the toolkit component modules plug into this interface.

How it works
-----

AccDC generates independent JavaScript objects, called AccDC Objects, that include customizable properties and methods which are used to control the functionality, content, and behavior of each AccDC Object at runtime. 

This makes it possible to render any type of user interface component, including wizards, carousels, dialogs, toolbars, tooltips, popups, lightboxes, menus, banners, tab controls, drag and drop controls, toggles, sliders, calendar pickers, or any other type of fully functional accessible user interface component.

AccDC includes integrated ARIA support to enhance intuitive page structuring for screen reader users, as well as a recursive Announce method that can be used to send textual messages to be dynamically announced for screen reader users. Additional ARIA attributes may be dynamically added to enhance advanced controls using AccDC's in-built Flow Control methods. 

AccDC renders HTML/XHTML valid markup, HTML5, DOM nodes, JavaScript output, XML node content, JSON object data, and content from remote API callbacks. 

AccDC automates accessibility by managing the processes associated with dynamic content rendering, so that the majority of common accessibility issues are automatically addressed when DOM manipulation occurs.
