The AccDC API for jQuery R2.0.3 (01/24/2013)
=====

AccDC is a scalable, cross-browser and cross-platform compatible Dynamic Content Management System that automates the rendering of dynamic content to ensure accessibility for screen reader and keyboard only users.

This version of AccDC is an API that interfaces with jQuery as an extension.
All of the toolkit component modules plug into this interface.

How it works
-----

AccDC generates independent JavaScript objects, called AccDC Objects, that include customizable properties and methods which are used to control the functionality, content, and behavior of each AccDC Object at runtime. 

This makes it possible to render any type of user interface component, including wizards, carousels, dialogs, toolbars, tooltips, popups, lightboxes, menus, banners, tab controls, drag and drop controls, toggles, sliders, calendar pickers, or any other type of fully functional accessible user interface component.

AccDC includes integrated ARIA support to enhance intuitive page structuring for screen reader users, as well as a recursive Announce method that can be used to send textual messages to be dynamically announced for screen reader users. Additional ARIA attributes may be dynamically added to enhance advanced controls using AccDC's in-built Flow Control methods. 

AccDC renders HTML/XHTML valid markup, HTML5, DOM nodes, JavaScript output, XML node content, JSON object data, and content from remote API callbacks. 

AccDC automates accessibility by managing the processes associated with dynamic content rendering, so that the majority of common accessibility issues are automatically addressed when DOM manipulation occurs.

AccDC Component Library
-----

The AccDC Component Library is a collection of accessible control types that automate the structural and functional accessibility of each control according to relevant accessibility best practices. The controls can be populated with any type of content, and can be styled to fit any type of user interface layout, in any language, without negatively impacting accessibility. The controls tap into the accessibility features of the AccDC API to render content in an accessible manner, then apply supporting markup and scripting to automatically ensure accessibility for screen reader and keyboard only users. This makes it possible for developers to add fully customizable components, that look and feel exactly as they desire, while ensuring functional accessibility at the same time without the risk of coding misinterpretation by those who are unfamiliar with ATs. 

The following modules are included:

* Accessible Modal controls.
* Accessible Banner controls.
* Accessible Tooltip controls.
* Accessible Popup controls.
* ARIA Tab controls.
* ARIA context sensitive dropdown Menu controls. 
* ARIA Tree controls. 
* Screen reader accessible Drag and Drop controls. 
* Auto Suggestion Search Field controls. 
* ARIA Listbox controls that support optional sortability, list item deletion, and dynamic addition of list items. 
* ARIA Footnote controls. 
* Accessible Live Chat controls. 
* Horizontal and vertical ARIA Slider controls. 
* ARIA Date Picker controls. 
* Accessible Accordion controls. 
* Accessible Carousel, Slideshow, and Wizard controls. 
* ARIA Radio Button controls. 
* ARIA Toggle and Checkbox controls.
