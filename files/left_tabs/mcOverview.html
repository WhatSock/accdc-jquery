<div class="intro content">
<p>
AccDC is a free development resource for international businesses, organizations, and academic institutions wishing to incorporate Accessible Innovation within future web technologies.
</p>
<p>
"Accessible Innovation" refers to the creation of new technologies that include Accessibility as a core platform feature of development.
</p>
<p>
AccDC functions as a rendering engine, which acts as a conduit for the accessible processing of dynamic content.
</p>
<p>
Developers can now build fully functional, scalable, feature rich, accessible user interface components that are encapsulated as AccDC Objects, which can then be freely distributed to empower the creation of accessible controls, widgets, features, and applications within all future web technologies.
</p>
<p>
The WhatSock Template Downloads are provided as customizable functionality templates that can be easily adapted to fit the design and implementation requirements of any application, and are accessible for screen reader and keyboard only users.
</p>
<p>
AccDC can be used within mobile browsers such as the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices for cross platform compatibility, and can also be used within the web browser components of desktop applications for enterprise distribution.

How It Works
</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="intro content">
<p>
AccDC generates independent JavaScript objects, called AccDC Objects, that include customizable properties and methods which are used to control the functionality, content, and behavior of each AccDC Object at runtime.
</p>
<p>
This makes it possible to render any type of user interface component, including wizards, carousels, dialogs, toolbars, tooltips, popups, lightboxes, menus, banners, tab controls, drag and drop controls, toggles, sliders, calendar pickers, or any other type of fully functional accessible user interface component.
</p>
<p>
AccDC includes integrated ARIA support to enhance intuitive page structuring for screen reader users, as well as a recursive Announce method that
can be used to send textual messages to be dynamically announced for screen reader users. Additional ARIA attributes may be dynamically added to enhance advanced controls using AccDC's in-built Flow Control methods.
</p>
<p>
AccDC renders HTML/XHTML valid markup, HTML5, DOM nodes, JavaScript output, XML node content, JSON object data, and content from remote API callbacks.
</p>
<p>
AccDC automates accessibility by managing the processes associated with dynamic content rendering, so that the majority of common accessibility issues are automatically addressed when DOM manipulation occurs.
</p>
<p>
Since AccDC Objects consist of object literal declarations, they can be redistributed as fully functional encapsulated components that include in-built accessibility for screen reader and keyboard only users, so that accessible user interface components will propagate across various web technologies.
</p>
<p>
When AccDC Objects are opened in the DOM, the specified content is surrounded by a framework of supporting Divs that convey important role and state information for screen reader users. Based on the customizations within the AccDC Object, the content is then inserted into the DOM in an accessible location, supporting accessibility markup is added, display styling is set, behavioral settings are applied, and Flow Control methods are executed.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, AccDC Objects can be interfaced with other AccDC Objects to perform complex tasks, or nested within one another to preserve parent/child relationships.
</p>
<p>
AccDC is a closed system, and functions as a standalone API, or may be used in conjunction with any library or framework without conflict.
</p>
<p>
Since the <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#app-epubReadingSystem" target="_blank">EPUB3</a> specification supports the use of JavaScript, AccDC may also be included within EPUB3 compliant eBook publications to automate accessible dynamic behaviors within browser based eBook readers.

AccDC Bootstrap
</span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="intro content">
<p>
AccDC Bootstrap is an HTML parser that renders advanced, accessible interactive controls using semantic HTML markup.
</p>
<p>
Bootstrapping refers to the use of semantic HTML markup to configure advanced controls, which are then magically converted into dynamic interactive components when the content finishes loading.
</p>
<p>
This allows developers to include complex functionality that is fully configurable across thousands of web pages, without having to program individual components using JavaScript. 
</p>
<p>
AccDC Bootstrap is designed to automatically enforce accessibility, while making it possible to populate individual components with any type of content, in any language, using any visual styling.
